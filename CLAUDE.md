# Programming Language Implementation Plan - Phased Development

## Language Overview
A general-purpose programming language built with Go, featuring clean syntax inspired by modern languages with C-style control flow.

## Phase 1: Foundation & Basic Parsing âœ… COMPLETED
**Goal**: Get basic tokenization and parsing working

### Tasks:
- âœ… Set up Go module structure and project organization
- âœ… Implement lexer for basic tokens (numbers, strings, identifiers, operators)
- âœ… Create basic AST node types
- âœ… Build simple recursive descent parser for expressions
- âœ… Parse basic variable assignments: `a = 42`

**Milestone**: âœ… Can tokenize and parse simple assignments

### Implemented Features:
- Complete lexer with all token types (keywords, operators, literals)
- Recursive descent parser with operator precedence
- AST nodes for expressions, statements, and literals
- Support for variable assignments, arithmetic expressions, comparisons
- Array literals parsing
- Comment handling (# syntax)
- Working CLI interface with example programs

### Architecture:
```
rush/
â”œâ”€â”€ cmd/rush/main.go  # CLI entry point
â”œâ”€â”€ lexer/           # Tokenization (token.go, lexer.go)
â”œâ”€â”€ parser/          # AST generation (parser.go)
â”œâ”€â”€ ast/             # AST node definitions (ast.go)
â”œâ”€â”€ interpreter/     # Evaluation engine (Phase 2)
â”œâ”€â”€ examples/        # Test programs (test.rush)
â”œâ”€â”€ go.mod           # Go module
â”œâ”€â”€ CLAUDE.md        # Implementation plan
â””â”€â”€ PROMPTS.md       # Language design requirements
```

## Phase 2: Basic Interpreter âœ… COMPLETED
**Goal**: Execute simple programs

### Tasks:
- âœ… Implement value representation (numbers, strings, booleans)
- âœ… Create environment/scope system for variables
- âœ… Build expression evaluator for arithmetic and comparisons
- âœ… Add variable storage and retrieval

**Milestone**: âœ… Can execute `a = 5; b = a + 3`

### Implemented Features:
- Complete value system with Integer, Float, String, Boolean, Array, and Null types
- Environment system with variable scope support
- Expression evaluation for arithmetic, comparison, and logical operations
- Mixed-type arithmetic (integer/float operations)
- String concatenation
- Array literal support
- Comprehensive error handling with runtime error reporting
- Updated CLI to execute programs instead of just parsing

## Phase 3: Control Flow
**Goal**: Add conditionals and basic program flow

### Tasks:
- Parse and evaluate if/else statements (expression-based)
- Implement boolean logic operators (&&, ||, !)
- Add comparison operators

**Milestone**: Can execute conditional expressions

## Phase 4: Functions
**Goal**: Function definitions and calls

### Tasks:
- Parse function declarations with `fn` keyword
- Implement function call parsing and evaluation
- Add parameter binding and local scope
- Implement `return` statements

**Milestone**: Can define and call functions

## Phase 5: Loops & Arrays
**Goal**: Complete core language features

### Tasks:
- Implement for loops (C-style) and while loops
- Add array literals `[1, 2, 3]` and indexing
- Array operations and built-ins

**Milestone**: Full language feature set working

## Phase 6: Polish & Tools
**Goal**: Production-ready language

### Tasks:
- Comprehensive error handling and reporting
- REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop)
- Standard library functions (print, etc.)
- Test suite and example programs
- Documentation and language specification

## Current Status
- Phase 1: âœ… COMPLETED - Basic parsing working
- Phase 2: âœ… COMPLETED - Basic interpreter working
- Phase 3: ðŸ”„ NEXT - Ready to implement control flow
- Next: Implement if/else statements and boolean logic

## Testing
The language can currently execute programs like:
```rush
# Basic variable assignments
a = 42
b = 3.14
c = "hello world"
d = true
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Arithmetic expressions
sum = a + 10
product = b * 2.5
isGreater = a > 30

# Complex expressions
result = (a + 10) * 2.5
message = "Hello, " + "Rush"
```

Run with: `go run cmd/rush/main.go examples/test.rush`

### New Phase 2 Features:
- Variable assignments and retrieval
- Mixed-type arithmetic operations  
- String concatenation
- Boolean operations and comparisons
- Array literals
- Runtime error handling
