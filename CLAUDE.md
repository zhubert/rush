# Programming Language Implementation Plan - Phased Development

## Development Best Practices

- Always write Go style unit and integration tests.
- Always update CLAUDE.md after completing a phase and then commit the changes.
- Always use two spaces instead of a tab.
- Never offer Expected Time or Time Estimates

## Completed Phases

### Phase 10.1: Core Class System ✅

**Status**: COMPLETED
**Date**: 2025-07-21

**Implemented Features**:
- ✅ **Lexer**: Added `CLASS`, `INITIALIZE` tokens, `@` for instance variables, `<` for inheritance
- ✅ **AST**: Added `ClassDeclaration`, `MethodDeclaration`, `InstanceVariable`, `NewExpression` nodes  
- ✅ **Parser**: Implemented Ruby-style class parsing functions with `{}` blocks
- ✅ **Interpreter**: Full support for class definitions, method calls, and object instantiation
- ✅ **Basic Syntax**: Enabled class definitions and object instantiation

**Target Features Completed**:
- Class definition: `class ClassName { }` ✅
- Method definition: `fn methodName() { }` ✅
- Instance variables: `@variable` ✅ 
- Object creation: `ClassName.new()` ✅

**Key Implementation Details**:
- Classes are first-class values stored in the environment
- Instance variables are stored in object-specific maps
- Method calls properly set up `self` context
- Initialize method is automatically called during object creation
- Full separation of instance state between objects

**Example Usage**:
```rush
class Person {
  fn initialize(name) {
    @name = name
    @age = 0
  }
  
  fn getName() {
    return @name
  }
  
  fn setAge(age) {
    @age = age
  }
}

person = Person.new("John")
print(person.getName())  # Output: John
person.setAge(25)
```

Part of Phase 10: Object System

## Next Steps
- Phase 10.2: Object Value System (methods, properties)  
- Phase 10.3: Inheritance System (class inheritance, super calls)
- Phase 10.4: Method Enhancement (visibility, class methods)
