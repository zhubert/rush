# Programming Language Implementation Plan - Phased Development

## Language Overview
A general-purpose programming language built with Go, featuring clean syntax inspired by modern languages with C-style control flow.

## Phase 1: Foundation & Basic Parsing
**Goal**: Get basic tokenization and parsing working

### Tasks:
- Set up Go module structure and project organization
- Implement lexer for basic tokens (numbers, strings, identifiers, operators)
- Create basic AST node types
- Build simple recursive descent parser for expressions
- Parse basic variable assignments: `a = 42`

**Milestone**: Can tokenize and parse simple assignments

### Architecture:
```
project/
├── main.go          # CLI entry point
├── lexer/           # Tokenization
├── parser/          # AST generation
├── ast/             # AST node definitions
├── interpreter/     # Evaluation engine
└── examples/        # Test programs
```

## Phase 2: Basic Interpreter
**Goal**: Execute simple programs

### Tasks:
- Implement value representation (numbers, strings, booleans)
- Create environment/scope system for variables
- Build expression evaluator for arithmetic and comparisons
- Add variable storage and retrieval

**Milestone**: Can execute `a = 5; b = a + 3`

## Phase 3: Control Flow
**Goal**: Add conditionals and basic program flow

### Tasks:
- Parse and evaluate if/else statements (expression-based)
- Implement boolean logic operators (&&, ||, !)
- Add comparison operators

**Milestone**: Can execute conditional expressions

## Phase 4: Functions
**Goal**: Function definitions and calls

### Tasks:
- Parse function declarations with `fn` keyword
- Implement function call parsing and evaluation
- Add parameter binding and local scope
- Implement `return` statements

**Milestone**: Can define and call functions

## Phase 5: Loops & Arrays
**Goal**: Complete core language features

### Tasks:
- Implement for loops (C-style) and while loops
- Add array literals `[1, 2, 3]` and indexing
- Array operations and built-ins

**Milestone**: Full language feature set working

## Phase 6: Polish & Tools
**Goal**: Production-ready language

### Tasks:
- Comprehensive error handling and reporting
- REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop)
- Standard library functions (print, etc.)
- Test suite and example programs
- Documentation and language specification

## Current Status
- Phase 1: In Progress
- Next: Set up project structure and begin lexer implementation
